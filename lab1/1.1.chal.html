    <h1>Rudyard Kipling, “If“</h1>
    <p>
        If you can keep your head when all about you <br> 
        Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, <br>  
    If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
        But make allowance for their doubting too; <br>  
    If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
        Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
    Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
        And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
